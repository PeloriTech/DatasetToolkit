# Dataset Toolkit

Dataset toolkit we use when building AI models.

## Export to TFRecord

The dataset toolkit has built in export functionality. An example script is given for converting darknet annotations into tensorflow annotations. You can find it [here](https://github.com/PeloriTech/DatasetToolkit/blob/master/scripts/export_to_tfrecord.py). Modify the script with your own harddrive locations.
